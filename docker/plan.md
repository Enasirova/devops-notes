🔎 What You’ll Be Able to Do After This

You should be able to:

✅ Explain what Docker is and why it’s used in DevOps (containers vs VMs)
✅ Read and write simple Dockerfiles
✅ Use basic CLI commands (docker build, docker run, docker ps, docker images)
✅ Connect the dots between Dockerfiles → images → containers → Kubernetes pods
✅ Relate it to your Jenkins pipelines

🧠 Optional Bonus (if you finish early)

Spend 10–15 minutes on:

reading a Dockerfile from your company and annotate it (e.g., comment what each line does)

mapping Jenkins pipeline steps to the Docker build → push → run flow
